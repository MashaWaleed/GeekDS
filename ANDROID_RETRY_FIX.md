# Android Retry Mechanism Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Issues Found & Fixed**

### **Problem Analysis:**
The Android application had severe retry mechanism overload causing hundreds of simultaneous retry attempts:

1. **Multiple Uncoordinated Retry Loops:**
   - Background coroutines retrying every 30s-2min
   - Error handler with exponential backoff
   - Network callback triggering immediate retries
   - Connection recovery resetting counters aggressively

2. **Race Conditions:**
   - Multiple threads calling same retry functions
   - No synchronization between retry mechanisms
   - Failure counters being reset/incremented simultaneously

3. **Exponential Retry Spam:**
   - Each failed attempt triggered more retries
   - No global rate limiting
   - Background loops continued during error states

### **Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **Added Proper Synchronization**
```kotlin
private var isRetryInProgress = false
private val retryLock = Any()

synchronized(retryLock) {
    // All retry logic now coordinated
}
```

#### 2. **Increased Retry Intervals**
- **Before:** Heartbeat every 2min, Sync every 1min, Commands every 30s
- **After:** Heartbeat every 3min, Sync every 2min, Commands every 60s
- **Recovery cooldown:** 60s â†’ 5 minutes

#### 3. **Improved Backoff Strategy**
- **Before:** 30s Ã— attempts, max 2min
- **After:** 60s Ã— (attempts/3), max 5min
- Prevents rapid exponential growth

#### 4. **Coordinated State Management**
- Background tasks check retry state before executing
- Network callbacks don't immediately trigger retries
- Recovery attempts are throttled properly

#### 5. **Better Error Recovery Thresholds**
- **Before:** Recovery triggered after 5 failures every 60s
- **After:** Recovery triggered after 10 failures every 5min

### **Expected Results:**
1. **Dramatic reduction** in retry attempts (hundreds â†’ dozens per hour)
2. **Better network resource usage**
3. **Reduced server load**
4. **More stable connection handling**
5. **Cleaner logs with meaningful retry patterns**

### **Testing Recommendations:**
1. Monitor logs for "Retrying" messages - should be much less frequent
2. Check that device still recovers from network outages (just slower)
3. Verify normal operation continues when network is stable
4. Confirm heartbeat/sync still work every few minutes

### **Configuration:**
- **Heartbeat:** Every 3 minutes
- **Sync:** Every 2 minutes  
- **Commands:** Every 60 seconds
- **Retry backoff:** 60s, 120s, 180s, 240s, 300s (max)
- **Recovery cooldown:** 5 minutes
- **Recovery threshold:** 10 failures

This should solve the retry overload while maintaining robust connectivity.
